  WHEN I enter a new note title and the note’s text
  THEN a Save icon appears in the navigation at the top of the page
  WHEN I click on the Save icon
  THEN the new note I have entered is saved and appears in the left-hand column with the other existing notes
  WHEN I click on an existing note in the list in the left-hand column
